The UPC ACM Student Chapter organizes a talk on Dec 20 at 12:45 in Sala d'actes de la FIB. 

The talk will be given by Cristian Canton. Cristian canton is a computer scientist in the field of artificial intelligence, working as a researcher at Facebook, Menlo Park. He will talk about his vision an experience to encourage other people to do the same.

Abstract: "Joining one of the many corporations or startups in the flourishing Silicon Valley market seems like a hard to reach dream. However, students coming out of our universities have all the necessary assets to successfully apply and get a job offer from many of these high tech companies. Sometimes, a bit of advice and guidance can be of help. During this talk I am going to give my perspective on what may be the path to get this objective, talk about my successes and failures and be open to a Q&A with all of you."
